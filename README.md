# Project Noema

**Project Noema** is a web-based game console that runs entirely in your browser, featuring a user interface inspired by the PlayStation 3. It provides a retro-futuristic gaming experience with support for custom games packaged in the NGP (Noema Game Package) format.

This is the **Open Developer Beta** (currently version `v0.16.0`), actively developed and evolving toward feature-complete releases. The project works both locally and when hosted, requiring no build tools or compilation.

**Key Features:**
- PS3-inspired UI with smooth animations and visual effects
- Customizable themes and color palettes (18+ built-in themes)
- Full keyboard and gamepad support
- Persistent settings and save file management
- Audio system with independent volume controls
- Performance optimization for various device capabilities
- No external dependencies for core functionality

Future releases will continue to follow the versioning rules laid out in `/misc/markdowns/VERSIONING.md`.

## Quick Start

### Running Locally
1. Clone this repository
2. Open `src/index.html` in a modern web browser
3. The console will start automatically

No installation, no build process, no npm packages needed. It just works.

### For Development
1. Clone the repository and open it in VS Code
2. Edit files under `src/scripts/` or `src/css.css`
3. Refresh the browser to see changes
4. Use browser DevTools for debugging

> **Note:** The project works both via `file://` protocol (opening HTML directly) and when served via HTTP (e.g., `npx serve`).

### Key Directories

* **`src/scripts/`** – Core JavaScript codebase. Modules are loaded dynamically via `preinit.js`.
* **`src/scripts/modules/`** – Reusable utility modules and third-party libraries.
* **`src/assets/`** – Fonts, icons, sounds, and other static resources.
* **`subpages/`** – Standalone mini-apps that integrate with the console.
* **`misc/markdowns/`** – Project documentation, TODOs, and specifications.
* **`vscode-extension/`** – Custom VS Code color themes based on Noema palettes.

## Development Guide

### Code Style
- **No build tools** – Write ES6+ JavaScript that runs directly in browsers
- **Tabs for indentation** – The linter auto-fixes formatting on commit
- **camelCase naming** – For variables and functions
- **Minimal comments** – Code should be self-documenting; comment only complex logic

### Common Tasks

#### Adding a Theme
1. Add to `bgColors` object in `src/scripts/bg.js`:
```javascript
"mytheme": {
    "top": "#color1",
    "bottom": "#color2",
    "accentColor": "#color3"
}
```
2. Add UI option in `src/scripts/ui.js` (themeTab section)
3. Optional: Create matching VS Code theme in `vscode-extension/themes/`

#### Adding a Preference
1. Set default in `src/scripts/preinit.js`
2. Create UI option in `src/scripts/ui.js`
3. Store value in `localStorage`
4. Apply setting where needed

#### Adding UI Sounds
1. Place `.flac` file in `src/assets/sounds/menu/`
2. Add filename to `sounds` array in `src/scripts/sounds.js`
3. Use `playSound('soundname')` to play

### Testing
Manual testing is required. Check:
- Keyboard navigation (WASD/Arrows)
- Gamepad support (if available)
- Settings persistence (reload page)
- Effects disabled modes
- Different browsers
- Console for errors

## Feature Roadmap

Current priorities (see `misc/markdowns/TODO.md` for details):

**In Progress:**
- Game loading improvements (better sandboxing, NGP format support)
- Performance profiling and optimization

**Planned:**
- Profile management (save/load user profiles)
- Drag & drop support for save files
- Enhanced local vs hosted mode distinction
- Dynamic local updates via GitHub integration

**Future Considerations:**
- PRISM-specific features (separate organization repository)
- Expanded game library management
- Multiplayer/networking features

---

## Archived Roadmap

### Version 0.16.0 Goals
- Add basic NGP support (decompression, loading)
- Implement local game storage (localStorage, web links)
- Create APIs for game-related functions
- Build UI for game selection

### Version 0.17.0 Goals
- Polish game APIs
- Complete NGP format implementation

### NGP Architecture Notes (Proposed)
- Package format: ZIP-based
- Structure: `/assets/` for resources, `/scripts/` for code
- Entry point: `start.js` at package root

These are design notes from earlier discussions and may not reflect current implementation.
