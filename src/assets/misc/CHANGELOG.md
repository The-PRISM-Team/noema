# Milestone: Games!
- working on it :/

## Pre-v0.16.0 updates
### UI Changes
- Added `⋮ Fast Reboot` to the `⋮ Power` tab to skip startup animation once on the next boot

- Added `⋮ Fast boot by default` to the `⋮ Preferences` tab so startup animation only plays on normal reboot

- Added `⋮ Set master volume` to the `⋮ Audio` tab

### Bugfixes
- Added click/enter fallbacks when startup or background audio autoplay is blocked by the browser

- Fixed background music volume handling so `⋮ Set background music volume` no longer double-scales with master volume

- Fixed loading progress behavior during preloading/startup

- Fixed startup flow edge-cases around refresh/reboot state handling

### Misc.
- Added startup state flags used by fast-boot and reboot flows: `fromRefresh`, `fastBoot`, and `fastBootDefault`

## UI Changes
- Made changelog text a bit more interactive

- Code blocks now work properly in the changelog dialog

- The startup logo and favicon now use Noema's new (conceptual) logo

- Added a battery indicator to the bottom left of the screen

- Added a `⋮ Set UI sound volume` to the `⋮ Preferences` tab to change UI sound volume

- Added `⋮ Open Project Noema's GitHub repo` and `⋮ Report an issue on GitHub` selections to the help tab

- Holding the Meta key now "neuters" certain actions, such as pressing Ctrl or Alt in the main menu

- Changelog is now hash-based, meaning that if the changelog updates without a version number change, the changelog now appears

- Remapped Ctrl and Alt to Q and E, respectively.


## API Changes

- Added `𝑓 last` to `𝘰 HTMLCollection.prototype` and `𝘰 String.prototype`

## Misc.

- Added `⋮ Noema` theme (will change if Noema's logo changes)

- Added `⋮ Trans Flag` theme

- Added `⋮ Frogleaf` theme

- Moved `⋮ Watermelon Sugar` theme up on the theme list for separation between flag-based themes and non-flag-based themes

- Updated save file format
